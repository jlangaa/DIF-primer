# DIF-primer
Code to get you started doing differential item function analysis in R

# Packages you'll need

- mirt

# Folder structure

There are four folders with some things in them. You can use this structure to keep your project organized as it grows.

- data - put your data here! There is practice data in here right now.
- R - put your code here!
- output - put any figures, knit documents, etc. here. This will help keep things organized
- reading - I put some readings here that may be useful for understanding DIF.
